Targets(01/09/2021)
1. complete D.B
2. add excel of hurricanes (Alabama & Misissipi & Alabamma tennesi &virginia)
    +state +date +strength

3. create function that calculates the correlation between strong hurricans (3+) and stock raise
3. create function that calculates the correlation between very strong hurricans (4+) and stock raise

definition of correlation(without s&p)-
if stock increased value by 10 % in quarter we define it as not strong
if stock increased value by 20 % in quarter we define it as medium
if stock increased value by 30 % in quarter we define it as strong
if stock increased value by 40 % in quarter we define it as very strong

how we going to achieve it
1.create "hurricane reader": a function that reads info about to hurricane(from excel) and arrange into an
object that holds hurricane's info

2 . "first step func"- function that looks for correlation between hurricane's level and impact on the stock price.
    a. for each hurricane find the quarter that will be affected
    b. calculate the average in this week .
    c. define the correlation (line 9).
    d*. find the general expectancy of the change (hurrican date to week avg) and the Standard deviation in percentage.
        - use Uniform distribution (for each hurricane)
    d**. find the (3+) expectancy of the change (hurrican date to week avg) and the Standard deviation in
    percentage.
        - use Uniform distribution (for each hurricane)
    d***. find the (4+) expectancy of the change (hurrican date to week avg) and the Standard deviation in percentage.
            - use Uniform distribution (for each hurricane)

    e. print informative output- company name + symbol + expectency & Standard deviation per *
